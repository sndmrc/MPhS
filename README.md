# MPhS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

With the `MPhS` package, the user can map their transcriptomic dataset
onto the Molecular Phenology Scale (MPhS) proposed by Tornielli GB,
Sandri M, Fasoli M, Amato A, Pezzotti M, Zuccolotto P, Zenoni S (2023) A
molecular phenology scale of grape berry development. Hortic Res 10
(5):uhad048. <doi:10.1093/hr/uhad048>

## Installation

You can install the development version of MPhS from
[GitHub](https://github.com/sndmrc/MPhS) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("sndmrc/MPhS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(MPhS)
## basic example code
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
